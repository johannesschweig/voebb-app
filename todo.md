* resort preview headers (title > person > summary > pages/language/isbn/year ...)
* sanitize details
  - remove tab character
  - remove ... at the end of value (title)
## Search
* make lens in searchfield dark when focused input field (no previous sibling selector in css)
* use previous session if not too old (keep track of requestCount??)
* create nice icons for too many hits, no hits or error
* create filters
  - medium (only book, game, cd, only e-resources/no e-resouces etc.)
  - year (minimum)
  - ISBN
  - person
  - genre: bestseller

  - Dias
  - Punktschrift (Vollschrift)

## Bookmarks
* display bookmarks individually as soon as they are loaded

## Preview
* cache multiple previews (10?)
* changing from preview to settings gives weird transition 
## Settings

  - allowed languages
* make it easier to tick libraries (by districts)
* split settings-libraries into a view component ("Your preferred libraries are:...") and a edit component: checkboxes
## Application
* add application icon
  - weird electron-builder problems
* enable auto-updating
  - is possible via snap
* remove electron warnings
* change application name
* put all reused strings in constants file
* investigate long load times
* add mocks for e2e tests
* improve e2e tests

## Rest

# DROPPED
* fix 403 forbidden and 404 errors for retrieving images
